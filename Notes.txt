BINARY SEARCH:
1. Numbers have to be in a sorted order
2. The start will be index position 0, The end will be the length of the list - 1
3. Midpoint is the Start + End / 2
4. If the midpoint is THE Same as the key, then the "found" flag would turn to true and will print "Number Found"
5. if the midpoint is LESS THAN the key, then then the Start will change to the midpoint + 1 and the end will be the same
6. if the midpoint is GREATER THAN the key, then the End will change to the midpoint - 1 and the start will be the same
7. if the number hasn't been found then it would print "Number Not Found"
